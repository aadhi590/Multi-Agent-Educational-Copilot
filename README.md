About the Project: Multi-Agent Educational Copilot
This project addresses a major limitation in current Educational AI: monolithic prompting. Standard AI tutors often lose track of their pedagogical role or give away answers too easily because they operate as a single, general-purpose chatbot.

Our solution is a Multi-Agent System (MAS) that breaks the "teacher" role into four specialized agents:

Planner Agent: Manages the learning path and curriculum.

Tutor Agent: Provides hints and interactive scaffolding.

Evaluator Agent: Assesses student performance and checks for mastery.

Coach Agent: Monitors frustration and provides emotional/motivational support.

By using Learning-State Estimation, the system identifies if a student is Confused, Progressing, or Mastering a topic and triggers the correct agent to intervene. This ensures a consistent, professional, and adaptive learning experience.
