Multi-Agent Educational Copilot 🤖🎓Operationalizing Agentic AI in Education through Role-Specialized Orchestration.📌 OverviewCurrent educational AI often relies on "monolithic" prompts that struggle with long-term pedagogical consistency. This project translates theoretical Agentic AI frameworks (as defined in Kostopoulos et al., 2025) into a practical, algorithm-driven architecture.By utilizing a Multi-Agent System (MAS), the Copilot dynamically adapts instructional strategies based on real-time Learning-State Estimation, moving beyond simple chat-based wrappers into a proactive educational tool.🏗️ ArchitectureThe system consists of four specialized agents coordinated by a central orchestration layer:Planner Agent: Manages curriculum flow and sets learning objectives.Tutor Agent: Provides interactive scaffolding and instructional support.Evaluator Agent: Conducts real-time assessment and mastery verification.Coach Agent: Monitors engagement and provides motivational interventions.Key Mechanisms:Learning-State Estimation: Classifies learner signals into states: Confusion, Progression, or Mastery.Conflict Resolution: Ensures cohesive feedback by mediating between agent-specific goals.Long-Term Memory: Persistent state management via Firebase for cross-session continuity.🛠️ Tech StackLayerTechnologyFrontendReact.jsBackendFastAPIOrchestrationLangChainIntelligenceGemini APIDatabaseFirebaseCloud/DevOpsAWS🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.9+Node.js & npmGemini API KeyInstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-agent-edu-copilot.git
